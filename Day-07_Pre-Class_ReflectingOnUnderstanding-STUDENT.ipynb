    "Thus far in the course we've gone through a number of fundamental Python concepts and practiced a variety of programming skills. For many of you, just a few weeks ago, you had no prior coding experience and now you're writing algorithms that tackle a variety of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key Python (and general programming) concepts we've covered so far to build algorithms include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Defining variables in Pythong (e.g. intergers, floats, strings, lists)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Doing simple math using arithmetic operators (e.g. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and concatenation of strings (also using `+`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Storing information in lists and manipulating them by change values or appending values\n",
    "\n",
    "* Writing `for` loops and `while` loops to loop in the following ways:\n",
    "    - Looping by integer or index (i.e. `for i in range(len(mylist)):`)\n",
    "    - Looping by value over a list (i.e. `for val in list_of_values:`)\n",
    "    - Looping by condition (i.e. `while n < cut_off:`)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Controlling code flow using conditional statements (`if` statements as well as `elif` and `else`)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Defining functions to write code that is **modular**, **resuable**, and **useful**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understanding error messages and trouble-shooting code when bugs arises (i.e. \"debugging\" your code). You've been doing this implicitly throughout the course!\n",
    "\n",
    "We also spent some time talking about **data ethics** and specifically looked at how things issues **data bias** and **algorithmic bias** exist in the modern world. We reflected on how these sorts of bias can be combatted and considered how we can hold ourselves to high ethical standards and uphold academic integrity as we work through the materials in this course.\n",

A person can deposit money in a retirement account at your bank, and the bank pays interest every year on the money in the retirement account. The mathematical expression for calculating the amount of money in the retirement account every year is:\n",

    "Before you start writing any code you should come up with a plan for how you've going to solve the problem. During this phase you should identify and define the variables that are revelant to the problem, the equations you're going to need to model, the overall structure of the program that you will write, and how you will make sure the code is running correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### You and your group members are expected to use the white board at your table (or a virtual whiteboard app like [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) or the [Aww app](https://awwapp.com/)) to write out your ideas to ensure that everyone is on the same page and allow your instructors to see your progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this planning process should involve writing \"**pseudo-code**\", a plain language description of the steps in your code (sort of like writing out in your code in form of a cooking recipe). **You actually already did a version of this on Day 1 when you and your group came up with an _algorithm_ for sorting people by their birthday.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, **an algorithm is**: a procedure for solving a problem in terms of the actions to be executed and the order in which those actions are to be executed. In other words, an algorithm is merely the sequence of steps taken to solve a problem. [[source](https://www.unf.edu/~broggio/cop2221/2221pseu.htm) of this definition]\n",

    "\n",
    "Things you should decide on during your planning and psuedo-coding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What quantities in your model are \"variables\" that will change as a function of time? What are the initial values of these variables?\n",
    "2. What quantities in your model are \"parameters\" that are constant over time? What are reasonable ranges for each parameter? \n",
    "4. How will you go about solving this problem for a given set of inputs?\n",
    "5. How will you check to make sure your code is running correctly. \n",

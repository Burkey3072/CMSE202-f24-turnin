    "\n",
    "*Code is read much more often than it is written.*\n",
    "<sub>~Guido van Rossum, Author of PEP8</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several proposed Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP), with the goal to improve the readability and consistency of Python code.  [PEP 8 is a document that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).  In your studies and career, you may spend a few minutes, or a whole day, writing a piece of code. Once it is written, you will likely not need to write it again, but you *will* likely need to read it.  And, others will need to read it and understand what you have written.  **Readability matters**, motivating the effort to write code following certain consistency rules.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous conventions for Python coding.  For now, we do not want to bog you down with all the details.  For now, we will focus on best practices for *naming* data types (variables, functions,etc) and for *commenting* code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing sensible names will save you time and energy later.  The best way to name your objects in Python is to use descriptive names to make it clear what the object represents. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Type \t| PEP8 Naming Convention \t| Examples |\n",
    "| :------- |:--------|:------|\n",
    "|Variable |\tUse a lowercase single letter, word, or words. Separate words with underscores to improve readability. \t| length_inches, list_groceries, my_variable |\n",
    "|Function |\tUse a lowercase word or words. Separate words by underscores to improve readability.| \tmultiple_by_three, my_function|\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "- Never use spaces in your names (use underscores instead so that each name is a string of characters)\n",
    "- Avoid single character names unless it is clear what it means (ex: `growth_rate` is preferred to `g`)\n",
    "- If variable contains a value with units, include units in the name (ex: `weight_kg`, `height_ft`)\n",
    "- Avoid capitalizing variable and function names (capitals will be used for naming classes/constants/others objects, that come later)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comment Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially when learning to code, **feel free to use comments often!**  This will help you understand your code and make it easier for you to review later.  If you are tasked with a challenging task, use a comment block at the beginning to describe in your own words the goal of your code.  \n",
